# Recruitment Application
This is a project for the course IV1201, Design of Global Applications, at KTH, Sweden.
This part of the project is back-end server that is part of a fullstack recruitment platform, where applicants can apply for the job and recruiters can read and approve the applications.

## API
###### prefix : /api/users/{role}/*
The server provides two separate REST api's.
The user role given in the path prefix determines what api to access
and which security configuration to use when authorizing the request. 

#### Rest API for recruiter operations
###### prefix : /api/users/recruiter/*
    - authenticate as recruiter user 
    - approve/reject an application
    - fetch applications filtered by competence (Paginated result)
    - fetch application by id

#### Rest API for applicant operations
###### prefix : /api/users/applicant/*
     - authenticate as applicant user
     - register as applicant user
     - fetch applicant object for authenticated user 
     - fetch application object for authenticated user
     - fetch application by id
